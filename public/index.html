        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>I guess You aree here because You have spoted some new tokens on etherscan with url of this page.

        <h2>2. Why I have got those tokens?</h2>
        <p>I send You those tokens for several reasons:
            <ol>
                <li>You seem to be active DApp user and DAI user as well </li>
                <li>I want to asses how efficient this method is in reaching users and ask for their opinion </li>
                <li>I want to know what do You think about my Idea</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>3. What I want to do?</h2>
        I want to build a trustless lottery working on xDAI Chain. This lottery will be connected to utility token
        that will have two functions:
        <ol>
            <li>Will be used to pay for right to participate in a lottery</li>
            <li>Will be used to vote on price to poarticipate in a lottery</li>
