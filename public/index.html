        <h1>Welcome brave DAI User</h1>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>I guess you are here because you have spoted some new tokens on etherscan with url of this page.
            If you wonder why I have send this tokens to You, see point 2). If you wonder what kind of DApp I want to build, <BR/>
             see point 3). If you want to know what this token is useful for, see 4).
             If you want to know how to express your opinion on the idea, see 5) </p>
        <h2>2. Why I have send those tokens to You?</h2>
        <p>Main reasons:
            <ol>
                <li>You seem to be active DApp user and DAI user as well </li>
                <li>I want to asses how efficient this method is in reaching users and ask for their opinion </li>
                <li>I want to know what do you think about my Idea</li>
            </ol>
            I've send this tokens to 1300 DApp users and I want to check how many of them I'm about to reach.
            To save gas costs and not to spam Ethereum beyond absolute need I did not create this tokens yet (that is why I call them ghost tokens)
            to claim your tokens just transfer them from one your account to other. If you wonder how I did it, just review
            the source code.There is some intereesting Bloom Filter magic to save the gas necessary to distinguish who can
            claim the tokens and who should not. By the way since it is a bloom filter, you have 1 in 181247 chance to claim
            tokens even if you have not seen event on etherscan
        </p>
        <h2>3. What kind of dApp I want to build?</h2>
        <p>
        I want to build a trustless lottery working on
        <a href="https://medium.com/poa-network/xdai-chain-let-the-decentralization-begin-1c6f2b255e58">xDAI Chain</a>.
        It needs to be truly trustless (no scam allowed! - details in point 6) ).
        This lottery will be connected to utility token that will have two functions:
        <ol>
            <li> (Utility) It Will be used to pay for right to participate in a lottery</li>
            <li> (Governance) It Will be used to vote on price of participation in a lottery</li>
        </ol>
        Final DLTR token (Dai Lottery Token) will be issued using
         <a href="https://medium.com/thoughtchains/on-single-bonding-curves-for-continuous-token-models-a167f5ffef89">
         bonding curve methodology</a> with 100% collateralisation so early users can profit from selling token later
         (when supply increases) and listing on exchanges is not a problem (perfect liquidity - you can allways trade with smart contract).
         Users will be able to buy tokens using xDai and sell them back for xDai when they wish  (no scam allowed!).
         Keep in mind that since bonding curve will be rising not flat You can still both profit and loose on that exchange.
         If it comes to tokens used to pay for a bet I plan to divide them 50/50. Half will go for development and half
         will be destroyed without taking back collateral which will increase buy back price for all DLTR holders.
         Therefore big token holders will be incentivised to market dApp further.
         <b>Other interesting property of this project</b> will be fact that the more popular it will be, the more DAI will be
         removed from circulation helping to maintain a peg. I've mentioned this Idea <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/aynw3t/dai_backed_ico/">here</a>,
         now I'm putting it under a test.
        </p>
        <h2>4. What this token is useful for?</h2>
        <p>When dApp will be ready, this token will be exchanged (on xDAI Chain) 1:1 to DLTR. Every DLTR allow for participation in one bet
            (on the begining, before governance will be implemented and price change will be voted in).
            Also 1 DLTR will give you one vote in governance process (on a price for future bets).
            Initial price for DLTR will be 0,1 xDAI
        </p>
        <h2>5. How can You express my opinion?</h2>
        <p>As I've mentioned I seek your opinion. If you want to express support for the idea just claim the tokens
            (to do so you need just transfer your tokens from one your account to another and pay for a gas) </p>
